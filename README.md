AngularJS Module for [Django REST Auth] Lovingly forked from the original at (https://github.com/Tivix/django-rest-auth)
==================================================================================

Purpose
-------

The Tivix Django Rest Auth code is rather quite well done. But I need it for another project and organized differently. 

There are some updates that need to be made like using ui.router and such. 

At this point this is not a stand alone project repo. But it is headed that way.
